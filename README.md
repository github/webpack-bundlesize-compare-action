# Webpack bundlesize compare action

An action that compares 2 webpack compilation stats files, and comments on the PR with a description of the difference

## How to use it

In your application, ensure you output the stats.json, from `BundleAnalyzerPlugin'

```js
// webpack.config.js
const {BundleAnalyzerPlugin} = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer')

// optionally you can also output compressed/gzipped stats. Requires a version >=1.1.0
const CompressionPlugin = require('compression-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...plugins,
    // not required
    new CompressionPlugin(),

    // required
    new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({
      // generate the stats.json file
      generateStatsFile: true
    })
  ]
}
```

Then, in your action configuration, build both the head and the branch (in any way you see fit) and pass paths to the stats.json files as inputs ot this action

```yaml
# .github/workflows/bundlesize-compare.yml

  # this action will error unless run in a pr context

        with:
          name: base-stats
          path: ./dist/stats.json

  # run the action against the stats.json files
  compare:
    name: 'Compare base & head bundle sizes'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build-base, build-head]
    permissions:

    steps:

This action requires the `write` permission for the [`permissions.pull-requests` scope](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idpermissions).
